# LearnThings

Learnthings is a flashcard app, inspired by Anki, and absolutely dripping with features. [A demo version is available here](https://learnthings-app.web.app/). This project is still a work in progress so use at your own risk. It is very possible that any decks you create may be disappeared in the future through breaking changes.

Key features include:

- Built for syncing and offline use. Use seamlessly on any device with or without internet connection.
- Highly customisable card templates, using the full power of [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).
- Card templates can include widgets (small components) to enable different methods of answering (self rating, text input, voice recognition etc.) or display of data.
- Choose from a rich variety of fields to store all kinds of data in notes, including generative fields, such as text to speech, LLM completions.
- Works great without AI, but built to be enhanced by AI features wherever this can add genuine value

Small disclaimer: not all of these features may be implemented yet ðŸ™„

See [frontend]('./frontend') and [backend]('./backend') folders for details on running locally and deploying.
